I work as a Senior Engineer in the CTO group at Enphase.  

Before joining Enphase, I spent five wonderful years at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities as a graduate student
in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.umn.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sairaj Dhople](https://sairajdhople.umn.edu/).
